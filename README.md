<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Joseph Paoli (but Joe is just fine!)</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a graduate research student at the UF/IFAS Florida Medical Entomology Lab in Vero Beach, Florida</h3>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **an individual-based model regarding the eastern black-legged tick, _Ixodes scapularis_**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Coding and modeling principles in my graduate research, and I'm taking entomology courses in the pursuit of my degree**

- 👯 I’m looking to expand my network with **people who conduct tick research or who know a thing or two about GitHub and Python**

- 🤝 I’m looking for help with **general programming literacy -- how GitHub and Python work**

- 💬 Topics I'd like to discuss are **those concerning ixodid ticks, but just about any historical or scientific field is on the table!**

- 📫 How to reach me **paolij@ufl.edu**
